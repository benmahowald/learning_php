PHP & Wordpress - CONTINUED SELF LEARNING
-------------------------------

Inspired by the wide use of PHP in the Twin Cities community
I've decided to learn it since I have now graduated
from Prime Digital Academy.

I'm running this Wordpress project on Local by Flywheel and working with custom themes and plugins in wordpress.

Updating media and working on creating posts.
