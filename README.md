PHP - CONTINUED SELF LEARNING
-------------------------------

Inspired by the wide use of PHP in the Twin Cities community
I've decided to learn it since I have now graduated
from Prime Digital Academy.

I'm running this Wordpress project on Local by Flywheel and creating a custom theme in wordpress.

Just wrapped my custom plugin and action script in a hook to serve js files.
